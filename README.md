# DenoisingResearch

This repository contains my implementations of the conventional Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithms my research partner and I studied over the course of the two month NSF sponsored REU in Computational Methods with Applications in Materials Science, hosted by Mississippi State University.

Algorithms included are: 

NLM  				    [1]
Adaptive NLM 		[2]
Sapiro NLM 			[3]
Block NLM 			[4]

Note I did not include any novel algorithms proposed/implemented in my research as it is still ongoing with hopes to publish.
